//! The declarative harness spec: **one row of data per harness, one renderer for all of them.**
//!
//! Every harness marion drives is launched the same way — a program, an argv, an environment —
//! and until this module existed each adapter wrote that launch out by hand, so 82% of the adapter
//! seam was per-harness code that differed in *values* and not in *shape*. A sixth harness cost
//! four hundred lines of it. This module turns the shape into a small closed vocabulary ([`Arg`],
//! [`Env`]) and the values into a table ([`HarnessSpec`]), so that a harness is a **row**, and the
//! only code a row needs is the handful of measured decisions no table can hold — a refusal, a
//! model rule, a derived URL — which stay in that adapter's `fields` hook and feed the renderer
//! through [`Fields`].
//!
//! # What is data and what is code, and why the line is where it is
//!
//! *Data*: which flags exist, in what order, joined how, gated on what. Those are facts about a
//! binary's `--help`, transcribed once from a measurement and never computed.
//!
//! *Code*: whether a launch is **allowed** — claude refuses an argv prompt because 2.1.220 takes
//! turn one before its MCP server is up; gemini refuses a missing model because `auto` hangs; a
//! canned copilot refuses a missing base URL because the CLI goes looking for a GitHub login. Those
//! are measured *decisions*, each with a fixture behind it, and enum-izing them would turn a
//! sentence of evidence into a variant nobody can check. They live in the adapters.
//!
//! # The risk a table invites
//!
//! A row is easy to write and easy to guess. Two rules keep it honest: `note` is **mandatory** and
//! names the spike that measured the row, and nothing here defaults — an absent value is rendered
//! as absent, never as a plausible stand-in. `adapter::tests::spec_render_matches_the_adapter_that_
//! measured_it` is the invariant: every row renders byte-for-byte what the hand-written adapter it
//! replaced compiled.
